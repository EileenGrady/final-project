  "description": "This idea is an offshoot of the Superfund Site Proximity map I created in MAP 675. The Superfund program was established by the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) of 1980. The program operates under the EPA and is responsible for the investigation and clean-up of contaminated sites in the US. The most highly contaminated sites requiring longer-term remedial action are placed on the National Priority List (NPL). These sites pose grave risk to human health and the environment, and the US is seeing the [largest backlog of Superfund remediation projects](https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2020-01-04/backlog-of-toxic-superfund-clean-ups-grows-under-trump) in at least 15 years.",
