    "First impression is that insurance coverage data is raw numbers, so I will need to normalize by the population. The data also breaks down into age categories, which I can considers as a factor when looking at vulnerable populations. This dataset includes categories for total population along with insurance coverage, and since the categories don't match up with the age group dataset I explored above, maybe I should just scrap the age dataset and use this instead. And if we're looking at vulnerable populations, I am not too concerned about those 'with health insurance coverage'."
