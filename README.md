# Exploring Industrial Pollution in the US
### Subtitle

## I. Introduction

In 1969, the burning of the Cuyahoga River in Cleveland, Ohio became a national symbol for the publicâ€™s outcry against industrial pollution. The public had been expressing increasing concern throughout the 1950s and 1960s, and the US reached a turning point when the Environmental Protection Agency was established in 1970. The EPA began to monitor and enforce the increasing number of environmental laws passed by Congress aimed at reducing industrial pollution.

Today there are two main programs in place that monitor industrial pollution in the United States. The Superfund program is responsible for the investigation and clean-up of contaminated sites left over from decades of unregulated industrial manufacturing and other activities. The most highly contaminated sites which require longer-term remedial action take precedence and are placed on the National Priority List (NPL). The EPA also monitors active facilities all over the country that are currently releasing toxic chemicals into our air, water, and land through the Toxic Release Inventory (TRI).

It is easy enough to obtain basic location information for both Superfund sites and TRI facilities, but an investigation into toxic pollution quickly reveals more complexity beyond locations on a map. This mapping project is a directed narrative told through a storytelling map format that begins by visualizing the general location and distribution of Superfund sites and TRI reporting facilities, and guides the user through several interesting case studies augmented with additional data sources that explore the wider reach and effects of these sites. The user will gain a better understanding of industrial pollution and the threat it poses to both humans and the environment. As efforts are underway to [roll back]( https://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2018/1/26/16936104/epa-trump-toxic-air-pollution) environmental regulations and budget cuts are increasing the [backlog]( https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2020-01-04/backlog-of-toxic-superfund-clean-ups-grows-under-trump) of Superfund remediation projects, this map will emphasize the importance of a framework that holds industry accountable for the toxic pollution it imposes upon communities.
